# ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUE 2020/2021

## By: Urias, Triumph B.

This project runs an analysis on all the teams and the 532 players that featured in the English Premier League during the 2020/2021 season based on some key statistics. 

DataSet source: https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbnF4TUNka1lmc2NvSUJkOUI4dE9qWXViQUNjUXxBQ3Jtc0ttZV9vbUQ4aFpQbldvMTBLU1JNbzRIczdhNjNFWGlQRE1MUjFNMkJmd3FmRFdPQ0ZzcXR0YU4yN2Y0VmY5VWdRMlFQalI3ZTJ0SER3NHFSYl9TSlBGeHRvUmpFOHM1OVNpeXU5X1pjZVVZZk5DbUpWWQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2Fe%2F2PACX-1vT5Te_FD6qxmH5ylngednvQxAdJ8tDVTaiyUlfcmPQe7D7iIocWnVmtTp4Ps_oapUygPQgeNNWcE6dj%2Fpub%3Foutput%3Dods&v=wmA4MCHsTGQ

## Key Insights drawn from the analysis:

**Insight 1**: Contrary to popular belief, age has rather negligible correlation with the number of starts, number of 
matches played, goals scored or asssists made by players.

**Insight 2**: The dataset investigated supports the school of thought that the older a player gets the few goals are 
expected from him although age has very little correlation with actual goals scored.

**Insight 3**: Almost 70% of all the goals scored in the 2020/2021 EPL season were assisted. This is a very high percentage 
and shows that football is truly a team sport and "1 man doesn't make a team".

**Insight 4**: This comes as a surprise to me. The fact that West Bromwich Albion has the largest squad. One would have 
expected some of the much richer clubs to have a bigger squad size.

**Insight 5**: Manchester City in the bottom 10 in terms of squad size? This is very surprising.

**Insight 6**: Manchester United had the highest number of Under 20 players and also the youngest team. On the other hand, 
Newcastle United had no player under the age of 20 and had the oldest team on average.

**Insight 7**: The Chelsea goalkeeper, Willy Caballero at age 38 was the oldest player in the 2020/2021 EPL season.

**Insight 8**: The younget players that featured in the analysed EPL season were 16 years old.

**Insight 9**: Manchester City having the highest number of assists and the highest number of goals really play football as a unit in the 2020/2021 season.

**Insight 10**: Harry Kane of Tottenham Hotspur having the highest number of goals, highest number of assists, highest goals per match ratio and the second 
highest assits per match ratio (falling behind to Kevin De Bruyne by only 0.08) was a really force to reckon with in the EPL during the 2020/2021 season. 

**Insight 11**: Every single club in the premier league picked up at least 30 yellow cards over the course of the season on the other hand, none of them picked 
up to 10 red cards.

**Insight 12**: Sheffield United had the highest number of yellow cards.

**Insight 13**: The evidence of Sheffield United having the highest number of yellow cards, followed closely by aston Villa and Manchester United 
(which is the youngest team on average) in combination support the theory that younger players were more likely to commit yellow card offences and we can 
also see from the coeelation map above that there is a 0.17 correlation score between the age and number of yellow cards received.
